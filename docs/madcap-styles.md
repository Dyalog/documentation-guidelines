## todo
- keeptogether  
  for printed version, a block which should be kept on a single page (without a page break)
- Five levels of headings. These are denoted with one to N octothorpes `#`  

    Headings should be written in [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case#Chicago_Manual_of_Style).

    Try to avoid multiple consecutive headings with no intervening text.

```
# Level 1
## Level 2
```


## Actions and instructions
Blocks which contain instructions should be surrounded by horizontal rules. The introductory line ("To do...") should be **bold**.

*For example:*

---

**To do this thing:**

1. Do this thing
2. Then do this things

---

## Examples
Introduce full examples with the single word "Example" or "Examples" (no colon) in a line on its own.

Exception â€“ if there are several consecutive examples illustrating different things, they can each be introduced with "Example: `<text>`" if that helps to clarify things for the reader.
